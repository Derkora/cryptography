# For the purposes of cryptography courses

This project contains implementations of encryption algorithms. Each algorithm has its own folder, containing the main Python code and specific readme files for further details.

## Running the Project
1. You can run any of the encryption scripts using Streamlit. Make sure to have Streamlit installed:
```bash
pip install streamlit
```
2. Choose the desired algorithm's folder and run its main Python script.
3. Interact with the encryption and decryption interface through the Streamlit web application.
